<h1>Sockso on iOS</h1>

<p>Sockso is currently waiting for approval on AppStore submission, but when
it is it'll be available for purchase.<p>

<h2>Browse Your Server</h2>

<p>Sockso iOS allows you to easily connect to your Sockso server from anywhere,
    browse, search and listen to all your music.  Easy!</p>

<h2>Browse The Community</h2>

<p>If you don't run your own Sockso server then you're also able to browse the
    list of available community servers to see if there's something you
    might like.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p>The app is priced at Â£4.99 - not cheap, but not too expensive to put you off
    I hope.  It's taken a lot of time, and this is just a hobby for me so it's
    my spare time that has been dedicated.  I hope you think it's fair.</p>
