<h1>Embedding</h1>

<p>With Sockso, it's nice and easy to take the music that you have, and
put it on your own website so that people can listen to it.  All you need 
to do is to copy and paste a little snippet of HTML!</p>

<p>Whenever you see the <b>Share</b> link, you can click it to get a popup
window showing you the HTML you'll need to put on your website to share
that music.  So for example to share your current playlist...</p>

<p><img src="{$filesUrl}images/manual/embedding-1.png" /></p>

<p>... just click share and you'll get the popup with the code you'll need.</p>

<p>Just select the text, then paste it onto your site.
Your visitors will then see the flash player and will be able to click play
and listen right there!  (<i>Aslong as your Sockso is running of course</i>).</p>
