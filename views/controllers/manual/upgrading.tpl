<h1>Upgrading Sockso</h1>

<p>Upgrading Sockso is very simple, and just involves downloading the new version!  All of Sockso's data is stored outside
of the application directory, so you can just grab the new version from the website and you're good to go.</p>

<h3>Package Managers</h3>

<p>Sockso is also available via some package managers, so if you're using one of those then just upgrade Sockso the same way
you would upgrade any other packages you have installed.</p>
