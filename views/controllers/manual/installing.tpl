<h1>Installing Sockso</h1>

<p>First thing you'll need to do is download Sockso.  You can get the
<a href="{$baseUrl}">latest version from here</a>.  It's a ZIP file, so unzip
it somewhere on your computer where you'll keep Sockso.</p>

<p>And that's it!  Sockso doesn't need an installer, it just runs right away!  So when you've
got that done you can move on to <a href="index.php?controller=manual&page=running">running sockso</a>.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>The only thing Sockso requires is that Java is installed on your machine.  Java
has become pretty ubiquitous so you're almosty garaunteed to have it.  If you don't
then you can go download the <a href="http://www.java.com">latest version for free from here.</a>.</p>

<h3>GCJ</h3>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Sockso is not currently compatible with GCJ, it requires a Sun
Java runtime.</p>
