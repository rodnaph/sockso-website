<h1>Imageflow</h1>

<p>As of version 0.8.8, Sockso includes a great new feature for browsing via
album art.  Just like iTunes/OSX and it's coverflow!</p>

<p><a href="{$filesUrl}/images/imageflow.png"><img src="{$filesUrl}images/imageflow-small.png" /></a></p>

<p>This great peice of javascript was developed by others, but was just
perfect for adding a whole new way of browsing music with Sockso.  Use the
scroll bar to move left and right, your mouse wheel, the keyboard, or even
click the albums to cycle through them!</p>

<p>Underneath will always have the usual Sockso links for playing the music
you're browsing.  Hope you find it useful!</p>
