<h1>Folder Browsing</h1>

<p>New in version 0.8.8 of Sockso is the ability to browse through the folders
that you've added to your collection via the web interface.  This feature is
disabled by default not to expose people's computers without them knowing about
it, but if you want to use it it's easily switched on (and off!) from the GUI
(or the property "browse.folders.enabled" if you're using the command line).</p>

<p><a href="{$filesUrl}images/folders.png"><img src="{$filesUrl}images/folders-small.png" /></a></p>

<p>When it's turned on, you'll be able to click the the folders and see your music
just like it actually is on your hard disk.  Be careful though, Sockso can only
play music that's actually in your collection, so if you see songs in there
that haven't been picked up by Sockso yet I'm afraid they won't be playable.</p>

<p>This feature allows more flexibility for how you want to organise your collection,
if you have any suggestions for making it better just come and tell us about
them in the <a href="http://forums.pu-gh.com">forums</a>.</p>
