<h1>Creating Playlists</h1>

<p>Playlists are a great way to let people listen to music you've specially
selected.  Your latest favourite tracks, mood music, whatever...  You can
even put them on your own website for people to listen to.</p>

<p>The first step in creating a playlist is to choose what music you want to
put in it.  So click the <b>Music</b> tab at the top of the window if you're
not already on it, and just start dragging music from your collection
which is listed on the left, to the playlist on the right.</p>

<p>You can move items around in your playlist, and remove things you don't
want there so don't worry.  You can drag single tracks into a playlist, complete
albums, entire artists, or even other playlists!  When you're happy with what
you have just click the <b>Save Playlist</b> button, and you'll be asked
what you want to call your playlist.</p>

<p>This is the name everyone will see it as so make it good!  Click the <b>Ok</b>
button and your playlists will be saved.  If a playlist of the same name already
exists then you'll be asked if you want to save over the top of it.  This is a handy
way to edit playlists you've already made.</p>

<p>When you've saved your playlist it'll appear under the playlists tab.</p>

<p>If you decide you don't want it any more then at any time you can right-click
the playlists and delete them.  Easy.</p>
