<h1>Adding Music</h1>

<p>The first thing you're going to want to do when you start up Sockso
is to tell it about your music.  To do this you'll first need to click
the <b>Collection</b> tab at the top of the window.</p>

<p><a href="{$filesUrl}/images/manual/collection-1.png"><img
    src="{$filesUrl}/images/manual/collection-1-small.png" /></a></p>

<p>This page then lists all the folders that Sockso will look for music
in.  When you first add a folder to Sockso it will be scanned to see what's in there.
Then Sockso will keep checking back for new music, so all you have to do
is put your latest music into the same places you've always kept
it, and Sockso will make sure it stays up to date (it'll also remove files if
you delete from your hard disk).</p>

<p><a href="{$filesUrl}/images/manual/collection-2.png"><img

<p>So click the <b>Add Folder</b> button and you'll be asked which folder
you want Sockso to look for music in.

<p>When you've found the folder just click ok, and you're done!  You can remove
folders you've added at any time by selecting them in the list and then
clicking the <b>Remove</b> button.</p>
