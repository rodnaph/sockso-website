<h1>Scrobbling</h1>

<p>If you log in to Sockso it will record all the tracks you listen to, and then
you have the option of downloading your "scrobble log" which you can submit
to <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>!</p>

<p><img src="{$filesUrl}images/scrobbling.png" /></p>

<p>Just click the scrobble icon in the top left of the screen and you'll be able
to download the log of all the tracks you've listened to.  These tracks will then
be marked as scrobbled so you don't get them again the next time you download
your scrobble log.<p>
