<h1>Browsing Music</h1>

<p>To get started browsing through the collection just click the <b>Browse</b>
button at the top of the screen.  It's all pretty self explanatory.  You can
browse by letter, click individual artists and albums, see popular tracks,
or view custom playlists created by whoever's Sockso you're using.</p>

<p>You can also use the search box in the top middle of the screen.  Just start
typing what you want to find and Sockso will show you what it's got!</p>
